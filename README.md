# Red_Queen_Model
This project explores species diversification dynamics under the framework of the Red Queen Hypothesis, which suggests that organisms must continually adapt and evolve to survive in an ever-changing environment. The project focuses on how different modes of reproduction—asexual and sexual—affect species richness and evolutionary stability.

Models Analyzed
1.) Asexual-Only Diversification: Species reproduce only through asexual reproduction.
2.) Separate Asexual and Sexual Diversification: Asexual and sexual species diversify independently without interaction.
3.) Switching Reproductive Modes: Species can switch between asexual and sexual reproduction.

Both deterministic (ordinary differential equations) and stochastic (Gillespie simulation) approaches are used to model the diversification processes.

Objectives
1.) Understand how reproductive strategies impact long-term species survival and adaptability.
2.) Compare diversification rates under different models.

Investigate stability and richness patterns through both analytical and simulation methods.

Tools and Methods
1.) Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) for deterministic modeling
2.) Gillespie Algorithm for stochastic simulations
3.) Python for numerical simulations and visualization
